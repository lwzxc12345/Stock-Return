# Stock-Return Forecasting with Linear Models

This project forecasts short-term stock returns using basic machine learning models like:
- Linear Regression
- LASSO
- Ridge Regression

# Goals

- Build a predictive pipeline using historical price data
- Apply EDA and time series feature engineering
- Train and evaluate baseline models

# Tools

- Python
- yFinance (for price data)
- scikit-learn (for modeling)
- pandas, numpy (data wrangling)
- matplotlib, seaborn (visuals)

# Project Structure
/data - Raw and cleaned CSV data
/notebooks - Jupyter notebooks (EDA, modeling, experiments)
/visualizations - Saved graphs and charts
/reports - Project writeup and analysis
